BioAid Architecture
-------------------

The image below shows a block diagram of the various components

* Flow diagram of the auditory periphery
* Discussion of the
* Flow diagram from presentation
* Discuss things in terms of auditory periphery here - only describe the necessary bits and reference where possible
* asd


The properties of this system
-----------------------------

* Designed for a closed fit - actually makes some sounds quieter
* The SNR point I made
* The transfer from MOC to instant
* DFAC - the delay always means that onsets will be instantaneously compressed
* The reduction of distortion products (and also their potential uses and benefits)

 

Wrap up
-------

* Hint at lab-based research
* -- Loudness scaling
* -- Tuning curves
* This is a blog - it is dynamic and can be updated as info available
