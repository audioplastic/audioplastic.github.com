This is the 3rd installment of a series of blog posts describing the technical details

This information is placed on my blog, allowing me to rapidly, and informally communicate some of the technical details related to the project while I gather thoughts in preparation for a more rigorous account.

The properties of this system
-----------------------------

* Designed for a closed fit - actually makes some sounds quieter
* The SNR point I made
* The transfer from MOC to instant
* DFAC - the delay always means that onsets will be instantaneously compressed
* The reduction of distortion products (and also their potential uses and benefits)

 
Stereo
-------

DFAC linked - instant primarily protective

Wrap up
-------

* Hint at lab-based research
* -- Loudness scaling
* -- Tuning curves
* This is a blog - it is dynamic and can be updated as info available
